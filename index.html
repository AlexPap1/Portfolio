                    Dog Meet Dog is a collaborative repository created within a team of four. 
                    It is a full stack social platform for pet owners that features backend storage 
                    for user data and REST to manage user posts. 
                    Users can create an account, and tie their pet’s name and breed to the account. 
                    Within their dashboard, users can create posts and upload photos for others to see. 
                    Dog Meet Dog is deployed to Heroku and uses several node packages including Bootstrap 
                    5.1.3, Cloudinary 1.30.0,Express 4.18.1, Handlebars 4.7.7, JQuery 3.6.0, Sequelize 
                    6.20.1, and MySql2 2.3.3. Structurally, Dog Meet Dog uses primarily JavaScript, Handlebars, 
                    and SQLThis allows for functions such as user login/sign up, 
                    comments, and the ability to get others’ posts, post your own photos, edit (put) 
                    your own posts, or delete them.

                    Pokémon Explorers is version 1of a WIP game application featuring the structural integrity of a
                    react (18.2.0) front end. It is a quiz game where players are tasked with achieving the highest streak 
                    possible by identifying the cries of the original 151 Pokemon. This featured a GameBoy styled UI
                    and the original cries from Pokémon Red and Blue alongside original watercolor artwork from
                    Pokémon character designer Ken Sugimori. Future development plans involve adding a daily 
                    role-play component which will give users the ability to enter biomes and "capture" specific Pokemon 
                    exclusive to each biome. Upon recognizing the sound, players will "capture" them and receive data in a user
                    dashboard. Generation 2 is also up for consideration!

                    What's That Movie is a collaborative effort within a team of three. It is a front end application 
                    that dynamically changes by utlizing multiple API fetches and uses client side local storage to save 
                    search history. Users will be initially greeted with 5 recent movie releases as well as a search bar. 
                    Users can search movies based on title, and will be presented with the top result, including the 
                    movie's title, year of release, poster, and a brief synopsis. The search will be saved through 
                    client-side storage which can also be cleared over time. Technologies used within this application
                    include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

                    This repository is a backend API tool for a social media platform. This platofrm has the basis of a 
                    node.js server and a NoSQL database, and this platform offers creation of both users and posts. Within the users is 
                    the interactivity of adding friends, and within the posts (thoughts), contains the interactivity 
                    of reactions (comments). This back end features 14 REST functions including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
                    Be sure to check the repository link for both parts of the usage tutorial! This repository uses entirely JavaScript 
                    alongside Node.js, NoSQL 1.0.0, Express.js 4.17.1 and Mongoose 6.0.13.
